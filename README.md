This is the 3rd project I completed as part of JetBrains Academy's Python Developer track.

From the project's description (https://hyperskill.org/projects/68?track=2):

"What can be better than a cup of coffee during a break? A coffee that you don’t have to make yourself. It’s enough to press a couple of buttons on the machine and you get a cup of energy; but first, we should teach the machine how to do it. In this project, you will work on programming a coffee machine simulator. The machine works with typical products: coffee, milk, water, and plastic cups; if it runs out of something, it shows a notification. You can get three types of coffee: espresso, cappuccino, and latte. Since nothing’s for free, it also collects the money."

I enjoyed this project's emphasis on functional decomposition and object-oriented programming. I decompose much of my data-analytical work into specific functions, but I don't typically write my own classes. This gave me good practice. I first coded this program as a series of functions, then I refactored it into a specific class better suited for handling state information.

Topics covered include:
- Python basics
- Computational thinking
- Functional decomposition
- OOP
- Classes, methods and attributes
